        <p>
            Welcome to the new home of the MKRS! MKRS is one of the most innovative and beautiful collections on Solana.
            It was originally designed as a way to bridge web2 and web3 communities and that will always remain a
            primary focus. There have been a lot of changes since the initial mint in summer of 2022. But we are just
            getting started.
        </p>

        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-clock-rotate-left"></i>Origin Story</h3>
        <p>
            How did we get here? The MKRS collection was originally launched by <a href="https://getbased.com"
                target="_blank">Based</a> (formerly known as Message Party). Based was a VC backed startup that was
            developing a Solana NFT-centric messaging application. Because of this the collection had two primary
            priorities: increase user adoption of the app and incentivize daily activity within the app.
            To this end the collection was relatively large (6,002 originally) and there were complicated monthly pool
            payouts tied to the MKRS owned and app activity. People then collected MKRS to maximize their monthly
            payout. The MKRS Pool multiplier system was extremely convoluted. Not only did it discourage new users but
            long time holders even struggled to understand it.

            The VC funding provided bi-weekly or monthly pool payouts to holders based on app usage and a
            convoluted multiplier system. In March 2023 Based announced that it no longer considered its app feasible
            and was shutting down the company. Shortly after that the staking platform they had been using also shutdown
            causing almost a third of MKRS to be permanently frozen. Management of the MKRS collection was then handed
            over to <a href="https://twitter.com/dissenTed" target="_blank">tedoc</a> in April 2023.
        </p>

        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-person-digging"></i>Transition</h3>
        <p>
            In order to preserve the amazing MKRS artwork and community it was decided that the best path forward was to
            remint the entire collection. This would allow us to make the owners with frozen MKRS whole while also
            establishing new creator and update authority accounts that weren't associated with Based. In September 2023
            the <a href="https://magiceden.io/marketplace/mkrs" target="_blank">new collection</a> was minted and
            airdropped to the legacy owners. The artwork and metadata of <a
                href="https://magiceden.io/marketplace/basedburn" target="_blank">old collection</a> was updated to
            indicate that collection was now worthless and should be burned. These "BURN ME" NFTs will never factor into
            any future plans.

        </p>

        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-plane-departure"></i>The New XP Meta</h3>
        <p>
            As part of the transition to a new post-Based MKRS world several changes have been made to the MKRS
            metadata. Any references to "Based” in the metadata have been removed. e.g. “Based Blue” hair has become
            “Basic Blue”. Without the app and the VC backing there was no longer a need for the MKRS Pool. All of the
            complicated multipliers could be scrapped. This includes Based Passes, Twins, Cards, etc. However since
            people grinded to get specific MKRS and likely paid a premium for certain traits we wanted to recognize that
            going forward. Our priority is to make the transition fair for everyone while setting the collection up for
            future. So the old multiplier system has been factored into a new XP trait. Each MKRS starts with an XP of
            1. If it is a twin then it gets +1, a triplet +2, a quadruplet +3, etc. This concept is applied to the other
            multipliers as well. This results in the individual MKRS having their rarity baked into their metadata as a
            trait that can be inspected in the secondary markets without having to understand the legacy multiplier
            system. The XP trait will be critical going forward.
        </p>

        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-rocket"></i>What's Next?</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of collection is to return value to the holders. We want to pump everyone's bags. MKRS have had the
            concept of dynamic rarity from the beginning with the introduction of new levels and traits. We will be
            cranking the dynamic aspect of that to 11! Instead of traits and rarity changing a couple times a year, the
            new mechanics will introduce updates constantly. Updating your MKRS will be in your control. This will be
            the biggest change to MKRS collection since its creation. More details coming soon!

        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i>FAQ</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Can I burn the "BURN ME" MKRS?</b><br>
            Yes! Please do. They serve no purpose and aren't worth selling.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Why can't I burn all of the "BURN ME" MKRS?</b><br>
            Many are permanently frozen. There is nothing we can do about that since the freeze authority was held by a
            third party. This was a poor decision on Based's part. This was the main reason for reminting the entire
            collection. They best you can do is to hide that collection in your wallet. We've been trying to reach the
            staking dev and if this ever changes will let you know.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>How do I know my MKRS is legit?</b><br>
            Simply check the creator address in <a href="https://solscan.com" target="_blank">Solscan</a>. Real MKRS
            will have a single creator of MKRSyd2sePfeSt1xE45Jf88pp1vHwHtd5T58h8b5agh.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Are there plans for First Verse or LISA?</b><br>
            No. While we love those collections and might include them in giveways or other promotions they won't factor
            into our long term plans. Based still retains the update authority and royalty wallet for those.
